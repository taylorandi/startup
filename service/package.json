We can print your designs if you submit an .stl file or we can model and print them for you.  ### website Specifications I plan on doing a website for a 3D printing company, I will have the customer create a profile and log in, their username will be displayed in the upper right coroner so that they know that they are signed into the site. They will then have the option so submit a file or a drawing to the site of the part that they would like a price quote on for printing. these will be stored into the database. Data that will be revieved from the server will be some sort of initial price quote based on the type of file submitted to the site. I will use HTTP, CSS, and Javascript to form the base and looks of the website. Authentication will be used for sign in, Database will be used to recieve the upload from the customer, and websocket will spit out an initial quote for the user. I will base this on my initial mockup sketch I have created so far for this project. ![Initial website mockup sketch](/mockup.jpeg)",
